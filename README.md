# web-scarping-challenge
## In this activity I created a web page that displays information about planet Mars and is dynamically updated at the click of a button to show the most recent data obtained from various credible sources. 

## Details
1. Relevant data is web scraped using splinter and beautiful soup from various sources containing publicly available information about Mars. The methodology is saved in a python function.
3. Using flask and the scrape function, the data is saved in a Mongo database collection.
4. The data is then rendered on to a html page.
5. The user has the ability to udpate the information by clicking the "Scrape New Data" button on the webpage.

Hope you enjoy learning more about Mars!
